\section{Introduction}

\noindent This document is the hazard analysis of the Pot-Pulator. This machine will be built for Sheridan Nurseries, filling trays with pots, preparing them to be populated with soil and seeds, to reduce the manual labour of the workers at the farm. The hazard analysis will consider each part of the Pot-Pulator, including the respective tray and pot droppers, the sensor verification section, and the conveyer belt. 
\\

\noindent The definition of a hazard used in this document is any issue or property in the Pot-Pulator that will cause a risk to the ideal result of the system. In this system, most hazards will be concerning safety of the workers collecting the trays at the end of the conveyer, and the effectiveness of the verification system. 
\\

\noindent This document will include the Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis, System Boundaries and Components, Failure Mode and Effect Analysis, and Safety & Security Requirements.  

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\noindent The scope of this document is to identify the components of the Pot-Pulator that could have harmful consequences to the users or the results and reduce each risk to a level where the overall system will be safe and acceptable. 
\\

\noindent Hazards will be analyzed based on research of similar systems, and any specific hazards occurring throughout the development process of the machine. 

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

The hazard analysis will be conducted based on the Pot-Pulator, which is restricted to the components below. 
\\

\indent 1. Conveyer belt
\\

2.	Tray allocation
\\

3.	Pot dropping
\\

4.	Verification system
\\

\noindent The hazard analysis will be based on these critical elements of the system. The system boundary includes a conveyer belt moving the system along, tray allocation to place the trays on the conveyer, a pot dropper to place the pots into the trays, and a verification system to confirm the correct placement of the components. 
\clearpage
\noindent The conveyer belt will be controlled by a sensor based on the other components. At the end of the process, the conveyer belt will bring the completed trays to the end of the line, to be collected by a worker. This will all be accounted for in the hazard analysis. 

\section{Critical Assumptions}

There are no critical assumptions for this system.
