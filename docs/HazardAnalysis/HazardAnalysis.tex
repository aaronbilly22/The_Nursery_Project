\section{Introduction}

\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}
