\section{Introduction}

\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | l |  l  l  l  l  l  l |}
    \hline
    Component & Failure Mode & Effect of Failure & Cause of failure & Recomended action & SR & Ref\\
    \hline
    Tray Dispensing & tray elevator motors fail & trays are not lifted into dispensinf position & tray elevator motor fails & have sensor that identifies that there is a tray currrently lifted into trya dispensing location & SR & Ref\\
    \hline
    Conveyor & Failure Mode & Effect of Failure & Cause of failure & Recomended action & SR & Ref\\
    \hline
    Pot Dispensing & Failure Mode & Effect of Failure & Cause of failure & Recomended action & SR & Ref\\
    \hline
    Verification & Failure Mode & Effect of Failure & Cause of failure & Recomended action & SR & Ref\\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}
