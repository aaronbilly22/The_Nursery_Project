Sheridan Nurseries Norval Manager

\section{Project Description} 
The current method of preparing pots and trays to be filled with soil and populated with seeds at Sheridan Nurseries is a process with little to no automation, requiring many manual labour hours. Recently, the owners of these farms have been finding it increasingly more difficult to fill these roles with enough workers to run the operation smoothly, and meet production demands. We aim to aid in this process by designing and implementing a machine that is able to fill trays with pots and prepare them for populating with soil and seeds. This will alleviate the reliance on manual labour and improve the overall efficiency of the farm.
