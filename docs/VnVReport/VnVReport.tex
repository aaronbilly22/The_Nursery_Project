\subsection{Verification Subsystem}

The bases of the verification mounts were recently expanded away from the conveyer by approximately 5 cm on either side, to address issues with the performance of the ultrasonic sensor along the conveyer belt system. The limitations were identified in the sensor's ability to accurately read values when the trays being measured were too close to the sensor as they moved down the conveyer belt.
\\ The minimum distance that an ultrasonic sensor can measure accurately depends on its design and specifications. In general, most ultrasonic sensors have a minimum range of around 2-3 cm, but this can vary depending on factors such as the sensor's frequency, beam width, and sensitivity. In this application, a 5 cm range worked best. When the first design was implemented, the ultrasonic sensors were mounted directly above the edges of the conveyer belt, resulting in the pots becoming almost directly flush to the sensors when moving down the conveyer belt. In this case, the sensor was not able to effectively detect objects at very close range due to limitations in its design or sensitivity.
\\ To overcome this limitation, the base of the verification mounts was expanded, therefore increasing the distance between the sensor and the trays being measured. This improved the accuracy and reliability of the measurements being collected to ensure that the data generated by the system was of the highest quality possible.
