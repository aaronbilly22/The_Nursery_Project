  Verification and Validation plan}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
  its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You
  can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project
  is done, they will be written.}

\citet{SRS}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.   You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You shoud do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may include
  ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates, or you may plan for 
  something more rigorous/systematic.}

\wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

\wss{Plans for design verification}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

\wss{The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also be verified.}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static verification of
  the implementation.  Potential techniques include code walkthroughs, code
  inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{If you have already done this in the development plan, you can point to
that document.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that
the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based
inspection?}

\wss{This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.}

Output: Constant speed of conveyor motor and belt

Test Case Derivation: Conveyor will recognize tray is present on belt and able to move forward

How test will be performed: A single tray will be placed at the start point on the conveyor belt. The conveyor 
will receive signals indicating that there are no issues with any other subsystems and the tray can be moved 
forward. Behaviour of conveyor will be observed to confirm conveyor has moved tray from start to end with no 
stopping. Test will be interrupted if tray is unable to move forward due to physical interferance or if conveyor stops.
\\
\item{CST-02: \textbf{Conveyor Ability to Stop}}

Control: Dynamic, Manual

Initial State: Conveyor moving tray along belt

Input: Simulated signals from pot dispenser indicating tray is beneath pot dispenser

Output: Conveyor motor and belt come to a stop

Test Case Derivation: Conveyor will receive signal from pot dispenser, indicating the tray is beneath the pot
dispenser, and stop movement of tray

How test will be performed: A single tray will be placed on the conveyor while conveyor is moving. A signal will be 
sent to the conveyor, simulating a signal from the pot dispenser sensor which indicates that the tray is beneath 
the pot dispenser. Behaviour of conveyor will be observed o confirm conveyor brings tray to a stop when signal is 
recognized.\\

\item{CST-03: \textbf{Conveyor Belt Friction}}

Control: Static, Manual

Input: Mass of tray, tilt angle of conveyor belt

Output: Maximum acceleration of conveyor belt

Test Case Derivation: Maximum acceleration based on friction between conveyor belt and tray will be calculated 
and set acceleration/decceleration values will be determined

How test will be performed: 6 trays will be weighed and the mean mass will be calculated. Each tray will be placed on 
the conveyor belt one by one. For each tray, the conveyor belt will be tilted until the tray begins to slip, at which
point the angle at which the belt is tilted will be recorded. The mean of these 6 angles will be calculated. These values
will then be used to approximately determine the maximum acceleration the trays can undergo without slipping, and the
acceleration of the conveyor motor will be set to not exceed 70\% of this value.

  Test Case Derivation: The count read by the subsystem matches the actual number
  of pots in the tray.
            
  How test will be performed: All other sensors and subsystems will be switched off. 
  The subsystem will be manually activated to count the number of pots in the given tray as it moves on the conveyor.
  The success or failure will be observed.\\

  \item{VST-02: \textbf{Operation from Verification Status}}
  
  Control: Dynamic, Manual

  Initial State: Tray has completed counting the number of pots in the tray and deemed it success or fail.

  Input: Status bit for success or fail of the pot verification step.

  Output: Signal to tell the system to continue/stop operation based on status bit.

  Test Case Derivation: The subsystem should signal the main processsor to turn off other subsystems
  when there is a problem in verifying the number of pots (ie. $ actual \neq target $).

  How test will be performed: All other sensors and subsystems will be switched off. 
  The subsystem will be manually activated to count the number of pots in the given tray as it moves on the conveyor.
  The success or failure will send a status bit to the main processor. The status bit will be observed.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item{Steven:}\\
    I will acquire skills related to dynamic testing of software and hardware. \\
    \item{Juan:}\\
    This project presents a unique challenge when it comes to group management and teamwork, this being one of few interdisciplinary capstones it is the only 
    capstone project(from my knowledge) that includes groups from vastly different engineering streams. While ECE and CAS Share many common teachings, engineering physics lacks that familiarity.
    this, however, in my opinion, is a great representation of the future. When working in the industry there are very few instances that you will be surrounded by those with similar knowledge sets 
    and backgrounds, most of the time the team you will work with will be of diverce experience and backgrounds. Understanding how to work as a team is detrimental to good productivity. I believe throughout this 
    project I will further develop my project management skills, they will be put to the test as each member of the team will have their expertise and we will be fusing knowledge to create a solution.
    Team management and general coding.\\
    \\
    Throughout this project I also wish to enhance my general coding skill. Which I have always had an interest in coding and have made attempts to use it whenever possible throughout my university career. I am excited to 
    take on a project with a defined goal and no clear solution to improve my coding ability.
    \item{Aaron:}\\
    Project management, team management, and time management are 
    crucial to the success of the project. Working towards improving these skills will
    greatly benefit me and my team members in the future.\\
    \item {Gillian:}\\
    Throughout this project, I am looking forward to learning skills from the other members of the team. As an Engineering physics student, the areas I would like to improve the most about are software and writing. I would like to be prepared for the industry and potentially working in a job that requires coding because it’s something I enjoy, but I don’t think it’s something I am experienced enough in yet. 
    \noindent In terms of writing and communication, it isn’t often where I am required to write long reports anymore, and I like the challenge provided by creating this extent of documentation. I look forward to my writing skills to improve over the course of this capstone project. 

  \end{enumerate}

  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item{Steven:}\\
    An approach to acquiring dynamic testing skills is practicing simulating testing conditions
    with our microcontrollers. An alternative approach is familiarizing myself with microcontroller 
    documentation and creating testing conditions from the knowledge I obtain. I will pursue the former 
    approach, as I feel the trial-and-error this will enable will be a better approach to learning how
    to effectively test specific portions of the project, while having the added bonus of allowing me to
    learn more about the software and hardware I will be working with.\\
    
    \item{Juan:}\\
        Project management skills can be developed throughout this project in many different ways.
        The first will be in taking a heavy role in the logistical and administrative side of the 
        team, another is to run the project management through an issue tracking system
        like the one provided by git hub. This might be tedious as it adds an extra step to all tasks as they will have to be
        updated and status regularly, but the pros outways the cons as this will help with the overall
        management of the team. Of the two solutions, both will be attempted however more emphasis will 
        be put on the task tracking software as it adds the added benefit of simulating how large
        corporations are running their business.\\
        To improve general coding two approaches can be taken on. the first being 
        that I can take on a software dominant portion and be responsible for its fruition, or I can volunteer
        to take one of these software challenges on with another member in my group who is better versed in
        coding so that we may work hand in hand. This way if there will be support and guidance throughout 
        and could offer a solution faster. The second option, in this case, seems more reasonable as there are
        hard deadlines for this project and the system itself is already ambitious.\\

    Working towards improving my team communication is something that I strive to do while participating
    in this capstone. This can be achived in several ways. One approach that I will take is 
    to strengthen my bond with the team members. In doing so, I will feel more comfortable in sharing ideas and 
    being constructive when necessary. Another approach is to document what each team member is working on and some of the problems they have run into.
    This will increase my team awareness and ultimately lead to the success of the project. I chose to pursue this skill
    because I know sometimes I want to do a lot of work on my own without developing trust towards my team members. This skill
    will help me when I become an engineer and work with large teams where communication and collaboration is crucial.\\

    I know I can improve my coding skills effectively by working on something closely to another member of the team who is more skilled in that area. I think this will be very helpful because I can work on a portion of software on my own, and if I have questions or get stuck, I will have someone working on something similar who will understand the problem and can help me troubleshoot. 
    \noindent I can improve writing and communication skills by reviewing and editing not only my own work, but the writing of my peers as well. After each deliverable is finished, I think it is very useful when we go over all the writing as a team and come up with ideas on how each section of the documentation can possibly be improved.
