\section{Introduction}

The current method of preparing pots and trays to be filled with soil and populated with seeds at Sheridan Nurseries is a process with little to no automation, requiring many manual labour hours. Each year, 250,000 pots need to be placed in trays, each one being placed by hand. Recently, the owners of these farms have been finding it increasingly more difficult to fill these roles with enough workers to run the operation smoothly and meet production demands.\\

\noindent We aim to aid in this process by designing and implementing a machine that is able to fill trays with pots and prepare them for populating with soil and seeds. This will alleviate the reliance on manual labour and improve the overall efficiency of the farm. \\

\noindent This introduction will outline the documentâ€™s purpose, the scope of requirements, characteristics of the intended reader, and the organization of document. 


\subsection{Purpose of Document}

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to define the purpose of the Pot-Pulator. It will describe how the software will interact with the hardware, and how it is expected to perform, defining the executable requirements leading to the creation of a final product. This document should lay the important groundwork needed for every team member to understand the in-depth technical details of the product to be developed, in preparation for the design stage. 

\subsection{Scope of Requirements} 

The branches of the Pot-Pulator include a conveyer belt, tray allocation, pot dropping and verification. These four systems will be implemented to work together to create an efficient product. It will be reliable, easily configurable, affordable, and will greatly reduce the need for hands-on labour in relation to seed population.  \\

\noindent The system implemented will be designed exclusively for Sheridan Nurseries, and for the pots and trays at their locations in a three-dimensional workspace. It is limited to usage on their round, 4-inch diameter pots and their respective trays. Considering the conditions of the greenhouses this machine will be used in, material degradation, water resistance, and pressure will all be negligible. \\

\noindent In order to maintain speed of the pots being placed in trays in a timely manor, one of the goals of the machine is to fill each tray with 10 pots every 30 seconds. This is the time it will take for the trays to be populated and move down the conveyer belt. With this goal in place, the machine will only need to be refilled with pots and trays every 15 minutes, greatly reducing the amount of hands-on labour from the workers at Sheridan Nurseries. \\

\noindent After the initial completion of the goal associated with the 4-inch pots, larger pots and trays may be considered as a future goal. There will always be the limitation of the requirement of a rim on the top of the pot, for the machine to easily grasp onto when lifting and dropping. \\


\subsection{Behavioural Overview}
The Pot-Pulator will have 4 branches working together to accomplish the task. First, the trays and pots will be manually filled into a section of the machine, ideally 30 trays and 300 pots. The first section of the machine will drop a tray, and the conveyer belt will move it to the pot dropping section. \\

\noindent The conveyer belt will stop once it senses the tray is in the correct position. The machine will drop pots until all 10 spots are filled. The conveyer belt will move the tray according to the needed positions for pot dropping, dispensing 2 pots into the allocated positions, moving forward 4 inches at a time until the process is completed. \\

\noindent The tray filled with pots will then move into a verification system, to verify the pots have been placed in the correct positions. The conveyer belt will then move it to an existing conveyer system, which will lead to the collection of completed trays. The only maintenance this machine needs is the refill of pots and trays every 15 minutes, and the collection of completed trays at the end of the final conveyer belt. \\

\subsection{Clients and Stakeholders}
\noindent This system provides a solution for all nursery applications that are not 
working on the cutting edge. For those nurseries that have an existing assembly line 
to fulfil their distribution needs, this is a great solution as other solutions replace the 
assembly line in its entirety and cost significantly more.\\

\noindent Clients include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sheridan Nurseries manager
    \item Sheridan Nurseries owner
\end{itemize}
\noindent Stakeholders include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dr. Smith (Project Supervisor).
    \item Juan Moncada, Gillian Ford, Aaron Billones, and Steven Ramundi, (Project Proposers).
    \item Nicholas Annable (Supervising TA)
    
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader} \label{sec_IntendedReader}

This SRS document is written for the individuals directly involved with the development of the Pot-Pulator. This includes every member of the team; all being involved with the development of the project. It is useful as reference to the functionality of in-depth details regarding the project, and will be read, reviewed, and maintained as the project progresses by all team members. \\

\noindent In general, any users of this document should have an undergraduate level understanding of software and hardware system functionality, physics, and mathematics. \\

\subsection{Organization of Document}

This SRS template is based on \citet{SmithAndLai2005, SmithEtAl2007}. These templates have been modified to reflect rubric requirements, and sections have been reorganized to follow 
the LazyBots student sample SRS. Sections 3, 4, and 5 describe the project constraints, and show the context and functional decomposition diagrams. 
Section 6 is dedicated to functional requirements. This section will define functional requirements seperated in terms of the systems which make up the Pot-Pulator. 
Section 7 describes the non-functional requirements in terms of look and feel, usability, performance, operational, maintainability and portability, security requirements. Section 8
 evaluates each functional requirement on its likelihood to change, and specifies how the requirement may change if it is not very unlikely to.


\section{Project Constraints}

This section identifies the
interfaces between the system and its environment, describes the user
characteristics, lists the system constraints, and provides assumptions relating to the system/environment.

\subsection{System Context}
The system will consist of a stack of pots, stack of trays, and the mechanism that will 
autonomously populate the trays with the pots. The trays will move along a conveyor system that operates at approximately 3 feet 
and will act as the operating workspace for the device. Once the trays are populated with pots,
they are fed into a soil potting machine in preparation for planting.

\subsection{User Responsibilities \& Characteristics}

The user will be responsible for refilling the stacks of trays and pots when the supply is depleted. 
The user will also be responsible for knowing how the entire system will operate within each state. 
For example, if a tray fails the validation step, the user must be capable of removing the defect and resume the operation of the machine.\\\\
\noindent The characteristics of the user will ensure smooth operation and workplace safety. The user should be 
able to lift a sufficient weight and have a good understanding of basic functionality of the system.

    All wiring must be tucked away and not accessible to avoid potential electrical failure.
  
  \item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Appearance3}:]
    All moving parts must be covered and protected. Moving parts should be covered to protect both the mechanism and the safety of the operator.

  \end{itemize}
  
  \subsection{Usability Requirements}

  \noindent \begin{itemize}
  
  \item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Usability1}:]

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item{Steven:}\\
    I will acquire skills related to programming microcontrollers and interfacing
    hardware and software. \\
    \item{Juan:}\\
    This project presents a unique challenge when it comes to group management and teamwork, this being one of few interdisciplinary capstones it is the only 
    capstone project(from my knowledge) that includes groups from vastly different engineering streams. While ECE and CAS Share many common teachings, engineering physics lacks that familiarity.
    this, however, in my opinion, is a great representation of the future. When working in the industry there are very few instances that you will be surrounded by those with similar knowledge sets 
    and backgrounds, most of the time the team you will work with will be of diverce experience and backgrounds. Understanding how to work as a team is detrimental to good productivity. I believe throughout this 
    project I will further develop my project management skills, they will be put to the test as each member of the team will have their expertise and we will be fusing knowledge to create a solution.
    Team management and general coding.\\
    \\
    Through out this project I also with to enhance my general coding skill. Which I have always had an interest in coding and have made attempts to use it whenever possible throughout my university career. I am excited to 
    take on a project with a defined goal and no clear solution to improve my coding ability.
    \item{Aaron:}\\
    Communication, team management, and time management are 
    crucial to the success of the project. Working towards improving these skills will
    greatly benefit me and my team members in the future. I also expect to further my knowledge in
    both hardware and software while working on this capstone project so it 
    can propel me into the future of becoming an engineer.\\
    \item {Gillian:}\\
    Throughout this project, I am looking forward to learning skills from the other members of the team. As an Engineering physics student, the areas I would like to improve the most about are software and writing. I would like to be prepared for the industry and potentially working in a job that requires coding because itâ€™s something I enjoy, but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s something I am experienced enough in yet. 
    \noindent In terms of writing and communication, it isnâ€™t often where I am required to write long reports anymore, and I like the challenge provided by creating this extent of documentation. I look forward to my writing skills to improve over the course of this capstone project. 

  \end{enumerate}
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item{Steven:}\\
    An approach to acquiring programming skills is researching and practicing specific
    programming exercises that are specific to the environment I will be working in.
    An alternative approach is familiarizing myself with microcontroller documentation and
    creating solutions from the knowledge I obtain. I will pursue the former approach, as 
    I find myself able to learn more effectively and efficiently with a hands on approach, 
    rather than reading through documentation. Approaches to learning how to interface 
    hardware and software include reviewing previous coursework, and immitating examples
    I find as practice. I will chose the latter option for the same reason stated above.\\
    
    \item{Juan:}\\
        Project management skills can be developed throughout this project in many different ways.
        The first will be in taking a heavy role in the logistical and administrative side of the 
        team, another is to run the project management through an issue tracking system
        like the one provided by git hub. This might be tedious as it adds an extra step to all tasks as they will have to be
        updated and status regularly, but the pros outways the cons as this will help with the overall
        management of the team. Of the two solutions, both will be attempted however more emphasis will 
        be put on the task tracking software as it adds the added benefit of simulating how large
        corporations are running their business.\\
        To improve general coding two approaches can be taken on. the first being 
        that I can take on a software dominant portion and be responsible for its fruition, or I can volunteer
        to take one of these software challenges on with another member in my group who is better versed in
        coding so that we may work hand in hand. This way if there will be support and guidance throughout 
        and could offer a solution faster. The second option, in this case, seems more reasonable as there are
        hard deadlines for this project and the system itself is already ambitious.\\
    \item{Aaron:}\\
    Working towards improving my team communication is something that I strive to do while participating
    in this capstone. This can be achived in several ways. One approach that I will take is 
    to strengthen my bond with the team members. In doing so, I will feel more comfortable in sharing ideas and 
    being constructive when necessary. Another approach is to document what each team member is working on and some of the problems they have run into.
    This will increase my team awareness and ultimately lead to the success of the project. I chose to pursue this skill
    because I know sometimes I want to do a lot of work on my own without developing trust towards my team members. This skill
    will help me when I become an engineer and work with large teams where communication and collaboration is crucial.\\
    \item {Gillian:}\\
    I know I can improve my coding skills effectively by working on something closely to another member of the team who is more skilled in that area. I think this will be very helpful because I can work on a portion of software on my own, and if I have questions or get stuck, I will have someone working on something similar who will understand the problem and can help me troubleshoot. 
    \noindent I can improve writing and communication skills by reviewing and editing not only my own work, but the writing of my peers as well. After each deliverable is finished, I think it is very useful when we go over all the writing as a team and come up with ideas on how each section of the documentation can possibly be improved.
